## My goal is to **shape the scientific vision** of a company which uses **computational biology or data science to impact society**.

More specifically, I envision my eventual ideal **role** as a CSO, or CSO-like person. I want to:

- interact with data analysis in a non-trivial way, either through doing analyses myself or advising on computational/data analysis work
- engage non-scientists and get them excited about our work and potential impact
- shape the long-term vision of the company I am a part of

My ideal **company**:

- impacts society through public health interventions or other population-level effects
- harnesses computational biology and 'omics data to achieve impact
- preferentially works in areas with large disparities, and endeavours to reduce them
- centers its values in every aspect of the scientific work it does

One possible long-term career goal might be to be a **key player in shaping the integration of precision medicine into public health**, specifically focusing on conditions _other_ than cancer (e.g. infectious disease, lifestyle-associated diseases, nutrition, maternal or women's health, etc).

In my mind, "**precision medicine**" means any combination of multi-omics or otherwise "big" data and some sort of fine resolution (e.g. at the individual or neighborhood level, and/or longitudinal).

That said, I'm open to any career path where I can use my technical training to reduce disparities and increase equity and justice in society.

## **Jobs that would really excite me:**

- Shaping the future of data (especially biological 'omics data) in public organizations like the CDC, WHO, or other large key players
- Establishing a data science team in an otherwise clinical or public health place (e.g. Data Science Director at the NIAID, Chief Data Officer in a large hospital or at a city or state public health agency)
- Early employee or leader at a company innovating on public health. For example, one that is creating new types of data for public health surveillance, and/or developing novel biomarkers for common diseases which have known health disparities
- Bonus points: a job that centers building up the open-source community and building up the civic data for social good movement
