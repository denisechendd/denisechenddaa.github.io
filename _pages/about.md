Hi there, I'm Denise Chen, mastered in Computer Science (Big Data) from Simon Fraser University

I'm currently working as a data scientist at Statistics Canada, Ottawa. I'm a big fan of Automation, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I'm doing some works on Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I'm also maintaining this blog to share my knowledge about ML and CV, as well as my work on both fields. You can find all my undergoing projects here on github: [My GitHub](https://github.com/denisechendd/Project).

### Achievement on Machine Learning
[Machine Learning by Stanford University on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/RJ9VZPFBQXTD)

Hope this blog help with your learning. And don't hesitate to drop me a line. I'll reply as soon as I can, promise!
