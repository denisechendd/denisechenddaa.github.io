Hi there, I'm Trung Tran, or you can call me Chun (that's how my name is pronounced in Japanese). I prefer both :)

I graduated from Electrical Electronic Engineering Faculty in Hochiminh City University of Technology, Vietnam. My research was mainly focused on Automatic Controlling.

I'm currently living and working in Tokyo, Japan. I'm a big fan of Automation, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I'm doing some works on Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I'm also maintaining this blog to share my knowledge about ML and CV, as well as my work on both fields. You can find all my undergoing projects here on github: [My GitHub](https://github.com/ChunML).

Hope this blog help with your learning. And don't hesitate to drop me a line. I'll reply as soon as I can, promise!
