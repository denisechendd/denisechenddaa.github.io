Wow, it's been a while but -- I defended! I'm a doctor now!

My defense was on January 11, 2019 and my thesis is titled "Mining the human microbiome for clinical insight."

The thesis will eventually be publicly available on the MIT libraries website, but for now you can also find it on [my github](https://github.com/cduvallet/phd-thesis).

A pdf of my [defense slides](https://github.com/cduvallet/phd-thesis/blob/master/presentation/2019-01-11.defense.pdf) is also in the repo.

Finally, I streamed my defense via Youtube and it's still up if you want to [watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIfIPvpILYs).

Woohoo!
