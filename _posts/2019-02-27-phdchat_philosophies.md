A few weeks ago, I got to give a really fun [talk](https://cduvallet.github.io/phdchat-philosophies/) to my lab and friends. A postdoc asked me to present at our lab summit (which is like a day-long group meeting), and I said I didn't want to talk about my science because I was going to have just defended! Instead, I decided to use the time to get on my soapbox and talk about some of the things I learned and approaches I took during my computational PhD. tl'dr - love yourself, treat the PhD as an act of radical self-love and you will reap the benefits.

You can see the full talk at [cduvallet.github.io/phdchat-philosophies/](https://cduvallet.github.io/phdchat-philosophies/).

Beyond just getting to share my gospel, I also used this as an excuse to learn how to make [fancy-looking presentations](https://gibbons-lab.github.io/ccmb_workshop/) like I'd seen Christian (a new postdoc in my (former) favorite postdoc's new lab) do.
Turns out it's super easy to use Reveal.js, and it lets you make presentations from a markdown file. Then, using github's built-in pages hosting, you can automatically upload it to the internet.

Some things I learned in this process, which are also documented in [my repo with the presentation](https://github.com/cduvallet/phdchat-philosophies):

- To preview the presentation locally, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from one directory above where you have your index.html (or from the same directory probably works too).

- To host the presentation online, go to your repo's settings and enable the repo as a page. Make sure that `index.html` is in a folder called `docs/` (or just follow the implied instructions from the github pages options).

Ok actually that's it -- it really is quite simple! Hopefully this post can help lower the activation energy for someone else deciding whether to try this out or not!
